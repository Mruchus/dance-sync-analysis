# Are your moves any good compared to your model dancer?

## Want to try it out?

I am working on making this accessible for everyone: non-programmers included! Unfortunately, I'm not quite there yet so you will need to install a bunch of packages (sorry!) and run the code on **macOS 12.5.1**.

###Â Dependencies 

Have these installed these before running:
* os
* subprocess
* glob 
* OpenCV2 https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
* math
* MediaPipe https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/install.html#installing-on-macos
* statistics
* Numpy https://numpy.org/install/
* Praat https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_mac.html
* Ffmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
<br />(Some come already packaged with the standard Python installation)

### Executing
Download the folder and run the main python file called 'sync_final.py'
